A tool to paste computations, transformations, and structures on a geometric plane.

Gridpaste
=========
Gridpaste is an online mathematics tool to share computations, transformations, and annotations on geometric structures in a coordinate plane. One starts with a clean board and places their geometric elements and performs actions on these elements in a recordable sequence. The sequence may then be saved and shared by a unique URL to colleagues or instructors. The tool is packed with a built-in function runner with annotations and placement of text in an orderly way to present a proof or construction.



> Thanks, [Brock](https://github.com/bramz), for the v2 rewrite in Python3/Django.


Requirements
============
    -- IE 9+
    -- Google Chrome
    -- Opera
    -- Mozilla Firefox


Notes
===
Many thanks to the team over at [jsxgraph](http://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/wp/) for the SVG board library. My inspiration for this application was that there exists many mathematic online tools for analytical, LaTeX sharing such as [Mathb.in](http://mathb.in) but none for geometry.

For any questions or concerns please [open an issue](https://github.com/jahan-addison/gridpaste/issues?state=open) or send to me directly at support [at] gridpaste [dot] io.
